ABSTRACT

Building Trust in Rural Producer Organizations in Senegal: Results from a Randomized Controlled 
Trial*

Trust    is    crucial    for    successful    collective    action.    A    prime    example    is 
   collective commercialization  of  agricultural  produce  through  producer  organizations.  We  
conduct  a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal in which we vary the number and the 
type of smallholder farmers — members and/or leaders of local producer  organizations  — invited to 
a three-day  training  on collective  commercialization. We  use this variation  to identify  
effects on  intra-group  trust,  both  direct  treatment  effects  of  having  participated  in  
the  training  and spillover  effects  on  farmers  who  did  not  partake.  Looking  at  different 
 measures  of  trust  in leaders'  competence  and  motives  and  of  trust  in  members  we  find  
that  participating  in  the training significantly enhances both trust in leaders and trust in 
members. For trust in leaders, we also find a strong spillover  effect. Our findings  suggest  that 
relatively  soft and non-costly interventions  such  as  a  group  training  appear  to  be  able  
to  positively  affect  trust  within producer organizations.

1    Introduction
Rural  Producer  Organizations  (RPOs)¹ can  provide  smallholders  in developing countries  with 
better access to input and output markets (Markelova et al., 2009; Rondot  and Collion,  2001; The 
World Bank,  2008).  Acting collectively  within RPOs is often seen as an effective means to reduce 
transactions costs, to gain bar- gaining power, to obtain necessary market information, and to get 
access to new technologies  and high value markets  (Devaux  et al., 2009;  Poulton  et al., 2010; 
Stockbridge  et al., 2003).  While examples  of  successful  collective  action  exist, such as 
coffee production, grading and export in Ethiopia (Kodama, 2007), green bean exports in Kenya 
(Narrod et al., 2009) and cotton production and exports in Mali (Tefft, 2004), many RPOs in 
developing countries struggle to offer the type of  services  that  would  lead  to higher  output  
prices for their  members  (Bernard et a1., 2008a, 2010; Fafchamps and Hill, 2005; Markelova et 
al., 2009). Instead of commercializing their produce collectively,  smallholders frequently  opt 
for sell- ing it individually  to traders at the farmgate (Fafchamps and Hill, 2005).'
Whether collective commercialization takes place or not is highly correlated with  the  ability  to 
 coordinate  and  the  prevalence  of  trust³  within  a  RPO  (Hill et al., 2014; Shiferaw  et 
al., 2011).  Mistrust  between  farmers  can even  lead  to the disintegration of  RPOs (Masakure  
and Henson,  2005).  Typically,  RPOs  are member-driven  organizations  whose success depends on 
their members'  partici- pation in joint activities.  Reasons for members  being  reluctant to 
participate  in collective commercialization largely play out at the intra-RPO level (Bernard and 
Wouterse, 2015). First, farmers may struggle with liquidity constraints and hence
'“Producer organizations are membership-based organizations or federations of organizations with  
elected  leaders  accountable  to  their  constituents.   They  take  on  various  legal  forms,  
such as cooperatives,  associations,  and societies”  (The World  Bank,  2008,  p.  154).  In this 
paper,  we analyze farmer  groups  in Senegal  that  provide  members  with services.  Hence,  they 
 differ from NGOs which also provide services to non-members (Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).
2This  paper  implicitly  builds  on  the  assumption  that  collective  commercialization  is  
more
efficient  than  individual  marketing.   See,  for example,  Bernard  et a1.  (2008b)  for 
evidence  that cooperatives’  members  achieve  higher  prices  for  their  produce  than  
non-members  in  Ethiopia, Shiferaw et al. (2008) for evidence that collective commercialization 
achieves higher output prices than individual sales to traditional  buyers in Kenya,  and Wollni 
and Zellner (2007) for evidence that  commercialization  through  cooperatives  achieves  higher  
output  prices  in  Costa  Rica.   See Section 2.2 for details about prices achieved by farmers in 
our sample.
3We define  trust as “a particular  level of  the subjective  probability  with  which  an agent  
as- sesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action” (Gambetta, 2003, 
p. 277) and hence  do not regard  it as being a form of  social capital  in itself,  but rather as 
being a measurable link between social capital and collective action (Ostrom and Ahn, 2003).

decide  against  participating  in  collective  commercialization as  it  involves  sub- stantial 
delays in payment as compared  to individual farmgate sales (Fafchamps and Hill, 2005). Second, 
farmers need to have sufficient trust in their leaders'  mo- tives and competences.  The sales 
processes  of collective  commercialization are typically executed by few leaders and are not 
transparent for members.  Members may  fear to not  be paid at all or that price increases  that 
occur through  bulking will not  be shared  with them fairly  (Buck and  Alwang,  2011;  Hill et 
al., 2014). Third, a farmer's decision to participate in collective commercialization is likely to 
be affected by her belief about the behavior of fellow farmers.  Trust in fellow members'  and  
their  commitment  is  needed  to  believe  that  the  minimum  num- ber of produce will be reached 
for bulk sales and, hence, to decide to participate (Bernard et a1., 2014).
According to the theoretical framework provided by Ostrom and Ahn (2003), success  and  failure  of 
 collective  action  is determined  by  a complex  configura- tion  of  various  forms  of  social  
capital—trustworthiness⁴, networks  and  institu- tions⁵—which enhance trust.  Trust is seen as the 
core link between  social capi- tal and collective  action.  It reduces opportunistic  behavior  
and transaction  costs (Collier,  2002;  Ostrom  and  Ahn,  2003;  Putnam,  1993).   “Trust  
lubricates  co- operation”  (Pretty  and Ward,  2001,  p.211).  We expect  that  a training  
interven- tion can strengthen existing horizontal and vertical networks and may even create new 
ones through  repeated  interaction  of  farmers.  We further expect  a training intervention  to 
clarify  the process  of collective  commercialization and the rules involved and, thus, to create 
a common understanding of the relevant institutions. We hypothesize  that such increases in social 
capital will lead to a positive effect of a training intervention on trust in members and on trust 
in leaders.
We conduct  a cluster-randomized controlled  trial to test these hypotheses  in the context of RPOs 
in Senegal.  We randomly invited members and/or leaders to participate in a three-day training to 
build social capital in order to induce mem- bers and leaders  to coordinate  towards  successful  
collective  commercialization. The training itself  consisted  of  three days of interactive  
discussion  on the bene- fits, conduct and constraints of collective commercialization and was 
executed in
⁴The term trustworthiness refers to intrinsic motivation as an independent reason for behaving 
cooperatively (Ostrom and Ahn, 2003).
⁵Institutions are the rules of the game that people devise (North, 1990).  They specify  which 
actions and outcomes are required,  prohibited,  or permitted,  and which sanctions  are authorized 
(Ostrom and Ahn, 2003).

collaboration with GRET (a French NGO) and PINORD (a Senegalese NGO). In all treated  RPOs,  a 
general  assembly  was convened  shortly  after the training  to discuss its content with 
non-participants.  All participating  RPOs had stated col- lective commercialization as one of 
their main objectives despite facing important difficulties in aggregating their members'  
produce.⁶
We assess how this intervention  affects trust in a sample of 798 smallholder farmers from 73 RPOs. 
 We analyze both intention-to-treat effects, i.e., the treat- ment effect  of  the invitation  to 
participate  in the training,  and  treatment  effects of  the  training  itself.   Our  main  
outcome  variables  of  interest  are  survey  mea- sures  of  trust in leaders'  competence  and 
motives  and survey  measures  of  trust in members  (Twyman et al., 2008).  We distinguish  
between  trust in leaders'  in- tegrity, informational advantage, efficiency and negotiation 
skills, and general and farming-specific trust in members.⁷ In each RPO we randomly varied the 
number of  members  and leaders invited  to the training and interviewed  both invited and 
non-invited individuals.  This enables us to analyze (i) the average treatment effect of whether or 
not a RPO was selected for training, (ii) the direct treatment effect of  whether  or not  an 
individual  was selected  for training,  and  (iii) the spillover effect on non-treated individuals 
in treated RPOs.
Our  results  suggest  a  positive  treatment  effect  of  the  training  on  measures of  both  
trust in leaders  and  trust in  members.   For trust in leaders,  the effect  is especially  
pronounced  for trust in their integrity  and their informational  advan- tage.   Moreover,  
results  suggest  a  strong  spillover  effect  on  trust  in  leaders  of non-treated members, 
i.e., that the sizable positive average treatment effect is not to be attributed solely to personal 
treatment. The spillover effect is especially pro- nounced for trust in leaders'  integrity and 
their negotiation  skills.  We show that while RPOs may face several constraints with respect to 
coordination towards col- lective commercialization, a relatively simple and non-costly group 
training may contribute  to a substantial  change in  trust  in leaders  and  trust  in  members  
and, thus, to clearing a barrier to collective commercialization and other collective en- deavors.  
 Social  capital  is often  thought  to increase  with  use,  thus,  the training may well have 
been the starting point for more collective endeavors to come.⁸

the RPOs.



The  remainder  of  this  paper  is organized  as follows:  We  begin,  in Section 2, by describing 
 the institutional  background  of RPOs in Senegal  and the issues with collective  
commercialization through such organizations.  In Section  3, we describe  the  cluster-randomized  
controlled  trial.   In  Section  4,  we  develop  the hypotheses  tested in this paper and 
describe our measures of trust.  In Section 5, we present our empirical strategy and estimates of 
the treatment effects on RPO- level and, in Section 6, on individual level. We conclude in Section 
7.

2    Background:  RPOs in Senegal
2.1    Institutional  setting
Seven out of  ten rural households  in Senegal  are members  of  RPOs,  and RPOs have expanded  
rapidly in number and membership in the last decades.  Between 1982 and 2002, the percentage of 
villages with RPOs rose from 8 to 65 percent in Senegal (The World Bank, 2008).  Senegal is a 
country with a vast array of rural institutions in thousands  of villages and with strong 
national-level organizations (Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).
The history of agricultural  and development policy in Senegal since indepen- dence can  be divided 
 into  two main  periods:  two decades  of  state intervention followed by two decades of 
liberalization.  Like in many other developing  coun- tries,  the Senegalese  government  initiated 
 cooperatives  in the 1960s  which  pri- marily  dealt  with the commercialization of  groundnuts.  
 The entire  value chain of agricultural production of groundnuts and cotton was organized and 
controlled by state entities such  as producer cooperatives  that were in charge  of  providing 
extension,  inputs  and  credit  to farmers  as  well  as of  collecting,  processing  and 
exporting  output.  Farmers typically considered  cooperatives  as an extended arm of  the  
government  rather  than  as  an  organization  that  they  owned.   Support  of the international 
community  led to the creation  and development of regional or- ganizations for rural development  
which aimed at specializing  and transforming agricultural  systems  in  the different  
agro-ecological  zones.   However,  these  or- ganizations  focused on the cultivation  of  a 
particular  type of  crop which was in contrast  to the reality of rural smallholders  typically  
cultivating  several types of crops (Bernard et al., 2014; Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).
In the 1970s,  this system of  rural development  went into crisis.  Throughout


6



the country, farmers founded the first independent farmers'  organizations  to rep- resent their 
own interests. In 1978, the Federation of Senegalese NGOs (FONGS) was established to reinforce 
solidarity and communication  among farmer groups, to  foresee  their  training  needs  and  to  
interact  with  the  outside  world  on  their behalf.  Foreign  stakeholders  became increasingly  
interested  in farmers'  organi- zations as partners for development  projects.  In the 1980s,  the 
new agricultural policy which followed  the near bankruptcy  of the country and a bail-out deal by 
the International Monetary Fund advocated the complete withdrawal of the state from  agriculture.   
Consequently,  the government  facilitated  the emergence  of  a new  category  of  organizations  
with  a  more  flexible  legal  status.   These  groups grew rapidly due to the support of their 
creation  and their preferential  treatment for obtaining  credit.  To defend  its own interests,  
FONGS  undertook  ambitious projects at the national level such as cereal banks.  In 1993, FONGS 
initiated the creation of a platform (CNCR) consisting of seven national federations of farm- ers, 
livestock producers, fishermen, horticultural producers and rural women.  Its objective  was  to 
promote  dialogue  and  the exchange  of  experience  between  its members,  to encourage  pooling  
of  resources  and  competences  and  to serve  as voice for the farmer  movement  versus the state 
and donors.  In 1995,  two other federations joined bringing the platform's total number of members 
up to about 3 million rural dwellers.  In 1996, an NGO (ASPRODEB)  was founded  that could disburse 
funds of  various  donors  and  offer services  to rural  producers  (Bernard et al., 2014;  
Bernard  and Wouterse,  2015; Mercoiret,  nd; Réseau  des Organisa- tions Paysannes et Pastorales 
du Sénégal, 2008; The World Bank, 2008).
The  role,  functioning  and  capacity  of  RPOs  has  changed  significantly  with
the gradual  liberalization of  the agricultural  sector.  They  have evolved  towards independent 
member-controlled entities capable of dealing with various kinds of partners.   Yet,  these  RPOs  
face  new  challenges  in ensuring  the commitment  of members.  This is particularly  true for 
activities related to collective commercial- ization  of  agricultural  output.   In fact,  while  
RPOs  remain  active  in  input  and credit  provision,  their  capacity  to aggregate  output  has 
 been  weakened  consid- erably.   At time of  harvest,  producers  are now  visited  by  private  
collectors  and traders.   This  has  led  to important  side-selling,  produce  is  not  marketed  
solely through the RPOs.  As a result, RPOs are seldom able to aggregate the necessary amount of 
produce to trigger economies of scale and bargaining  power at time of commercialization.  This  is 
despite isolated  evidence  that  RPOs in Senegal  can

7



in fact provide their members with profitable and reliable output commercializa- tion services.  In 
sum, in the absence of a sufficient amount of aggregated output, RPOs are not in a position to 
effectively obtain higher output prices which leads to further  side-selling  and  a lack of  
interest  of  members  for commercialization services offered by these organizations (Bernard et 
a1., 2014).

2.2    Collective action in Senegalese RPOs
Generally, problems of collective action arise “whenever individuals face alterna- tive courses of 
actions between short-term self-regarding choices and one that, if followed  by a large enough  
number of individuals  in a group,  benefits all” (Os- trom and Ahn, 2003, p.  xiv).  In the 
context of commercialization of agricultural produce,  farmers  who  are organized  in RPOs  can  
choose  between  selling  their produce  directly  at the farmgate  to a local  trader  with 
immediate  payment  and selling it collectively  through  their RPO. Farmers in our sample 
cultivate either groundnuts, rice, or onions as their main crop.’ While groundnut farmers primar- 
ily sell their groundnuts either individually or collectively for private gains, onion farmers  
have been observed  to engage in joint collection and commercialization of firewood.  Rice farmers 
use part of their gains from selling their rice (privately or collectively) for financing 
irrigation systems.
For collective  commercialization of  any  type of  produce,  the RPO's leaders will typically  
negotiate  with a contract  buyer who offers a higher price than the local traders if a minimum 
amount of  produce is sold.  This quantity is typically too large to be reached  by  just one 
individual  farmer  such  that complying  with the contract  requires  coordination  among  the  
members  of  the  RPO.  Moreover, these contracts tend to be rather discrete in the sense that they 
are void if a certain threshold of aggregated produce is not met and payments are usually made some 
time after the farmers delivered their produce to the RPO for collective commer- cialization  
(Bernard  et a1.,  2014).  In our sample,  two thirds of  the farmers  who report to have sold to 
traders in the 2010/2011  agricultural  season  (March  2010 to March 2011) state that they 
received the payment on the day of the transaction while only one quarter of  the farmers  who sold 
through  the RPO report to have received the payment on the day the transaction took place.
Senegalese  RPOs  appear  to be facing  significant  constraints  when  it comes

members and leaders.

to  collective  action  in  the form  of  collective  commercialization of  agricultural produce.  
Although  RPOs in our sample were selected  based on collective com- mercialization being one of  
their main objectives,  only  roughly one third of  the RPOs  in  our  sample  report  to  have  
engaged  in  collective  commercialization in the 2010/2011 agricultural season.¹⁰ On average, 
farmers who sold their produce through  the  RPO in  the 2010/2011  season  achieved  higher  
prices  per  kilogram than  those  who  sold  their  produce  individually.   Only  one quarter  of 
 the farm- ers  who sold their produce individually  to local  traders  regularly  dealt  with the 
same traders.  When asked about difficulties faced when selling their produce in- dividually, only 
20 percent of the respondents indicated that there were no major problems.  For the remaining 
respondents,  the main issue was lack of transporta- tion  means  to  reach  more  lucrative  
markets  (cited  by  48  percent)  followed  by insufficient  visits by potential buyers (17 
percent), lack of knowledge about cur- rent  prices  (15 percent) and lack of  sufficient  quantity 
 of  produce  to be able to negotiate a better price (8 percent).
While lack of  financial  means  and  technical  capacities  at the RPO level  are likely to be 
significant constraints to collective commercialization, members'  per- ception of collective 
commercialization and issues of coordination between mem- bers also seem to represent important 
constraints, independent of the type of crop to be sold collectively.  Leadership  has been shown 
to be a key element of  suc- cessful coordination  within RPOs (Agrawal, 2001; Bernard and 
Wouterse,  2015; Markelova  et al., 2009).'    On the one hand, leaders  need to have the necessary 
skills for the collective  marketing  and relevant  links  to outsiders.  On  the other hand, 
members need to trust their leaders (Arcand, 2002; Markelova et al., 2009). In those RPOs that 
engaged  in collective  commercialization, only 44 percent of the farmers  delivered  part  of  
their  produce  to  the  RPO  to  be  sold  collectively. Respondents  state three main reasons  
for why  they chose  to sell individually  in spot market-like transactions to local traders rather 
than collectively  through their RPO:  most  find  collective  commercialization to  be  too  risky 
 (without  specify-
'⁰We consider a RPO to be engaged in collective commercialization if at least one farmer sold his 
or her main produce (groundnut, onion, or rice) through the RPO.
''A   commonly  found  organizational structure  in  Senegalese  RPOs  involves  a  relatively  
cir- cumscribed sub-group of members bearing more responsibilities and more influence than others. 
Leadership status is often associated  with traditional social roles (Arcand, 2002).

ing the exact nature of this risk),'² some do not believe that it offers them a better price then 
selling individually, and to others collective commercialization appears to be a complicated  
process that takes up too much time.'3
RPOs engaging in collective commercialization differ significantly from those who did not engage in 
collective sales in the 2010/2011 agricultural  season (see Table 1).¹⁴ Their members are younger, 
own more motorcycles, are more likely to have savings accounts with banks and MFIs, and have larger 
fields. They cultivate groundnuts  and  rice  more  often  than  onions.   Moreover,  we  find  
significantly higher average trust levels in RPOs that engaged in collective commercialization than 
in those that did not.
Farmers who contributed part of their produce to collective commercialization in the season prior 
to the baseline data collection appear to be significantly  more trusting  than  those  who  did  
not  contribute  (see  Table  2).   Moreover,  they  are more  likely  to be literate  than  those  
who did  not contribute,  less likely  to be  a member, less likely to be related to a leader, more 
likely to have a savings account, have larger  fields and  more  motorcycles,  and  are  younger.   
They  are also  more likely to come from ethnically heterogeneous  RPOs, have been members of their 
RPO for a shorter time period,  are more likely  to be cultivating  groundnuts  and less likely  to 
be cultivating  onions.  Looking  at different  measures  for trust,  we find  a significantly  
positive  pairwise correlation  between  several  trust  measures and  an  indicator  for  whether  
a  RPO  engaged  in  collective  commercialization. Similary,  we  find  a  significantly  positive 
 pairwise  correlation  between  several trust  measures  and individual  participation  in 
collective  commercialization  (see Table 3).





'°The risk inherent in collective commercialization may be categorized into two types of risk: the 
price risk associated with freely working markets and the risk associated with being dependent on 
others’ behavior. On the intra-RPO level, the outcome of collective commercialization depends on 
the number of fellow farmers  who participate as well as the competence  and behavior of the 
leaders involved in the transactions.
'’50  percent  of  the  respondents  stated  risk  as  a reason,  30 percent  the  price  and  26 
percent the inconvenience  (numbers do not add up to 100 percent as answers  were given in free 
text and each  person  could  provide several reasons).  Information on this question is only  
available for a subsample of groundnut farmers.

Overall,  results  from  this  section  support  the idea  that  trust  in  leaders  and in  
members  may  play  a  significant  role  in  fostering  collective  commercializa- tion.  Aiming  
at enhancing  trust  within  RPOs  to encourage  collective  commer- cialization, we organized a 
three-day training and discussion around the potential benefits and difficulties  of coordinating  
towards  collective commercialization in partnership with GRET and PINORD.

3    Intervention
We  investigate  issues  of  intra-group  coordination  and  trust  using  a  sample  of Senegalese 
village-level RPOs for which we conducted a baseline survey in Novem- ber and December 2011. At 
that time people may have assumed that there would be subsequent  activities  following  the 
survey,  but no details on the intervention were given.  On the contrary, it was intentionally  
left unclear that there would be an intervention  for some  interviewees  in  the future.  The 
sample for  which  the baseline  survey  was conducted  was  drawn  from  a dataset  of  204 RPOs  
from 9 federations  belonging  to FONGS  collected  in 2009 from  which  we selected  all 
organizations  that stated collective  commercialization as one of  their main  pur- poses. 73 RPOs 
belonging to 7 federations satisfied this criterion. Figure 1 shows the location of the sampled 
RPOs.
We randomly  assigned  an invitation  to the training  intervention  to those 73 RPOs as follows:
•   23 RPOs served as pure control group, they were not invited to participate in the training 
intervention
•   50 RPOs received an invitation to participate in the training intervention

—  in 12 RPOs,  between one and four leaders but no members  were in- vited to the training
—  in 15 RPOs,  between one and four members  but no leaders were in- vited to the training
—  in 23 RPOs, between one and four members and between one and four leaders were invited to the 
training
In each of the treated RPOs, at least two persons received an invitation.  Invitees were  randomly  
selected  from  lists  of  members  and  leaders  obtained  from  the

2009 survey.  In all treated RPOs, a general assembly  was convened shortly after the training  to 
discuss  its content  with non-participants.  To be able to consider both  direct as well  as 
spillover  effects,  we interviewed  both  invitees  as  well  as non-invited individuals.  In each 
RPO, 10 non-invited individuals  were randomly selected for interviewing  purposes.
The treatment and interview assignments were not fully respected in all RPOs. In some RPOs, more 
than four members (leaders) were invited.  There were also instances  where  some  invitees  did  
not  participate  in  the  training,  where  more than  the  intended  number  of  individuals  
participated  in  the  training,  or  where the distribution  of  members  and leaders was not 
fully respected.  Moreover,  the number  of  actually  interviewed  individuals  (including  
invitees)  ranges  from  4 to  16  per  RPO  instead  of  the  targeted  10  to  18.   Furthermore, 
 due  to  missing information  on outcome variables,  we have to drop 8 individuals  belonging  to 
7 RPOs  from our  sample.   All in all,  we  work  with a sample  of  798 interviewed individuals  
consisting  of  150 invitees,  447  non-invited  individuals  from  treated

RPOs, and 201 individuals from control RPOs.¹⁵
The intervention consisted of a three-day training conducted in January 2012. During  the  
training,  all  participants  were treated  the same,  i.e.,  members  were not  treated  
differently  from  leaders.   The  purpose  of  the  training  was  to create awareness of the 
(potential) advantage of working together towards commercial- ization of  agricultural  produce  
and highlight  particular  group dynamics  that are conducive  to collective action.  In terms of 
content, role plays, simple games and group exercises were to demonstrate the advantages of working 
together in terms of  the benefits  that can be generated  and the costs that can be saved.  
Particular focus  was put on sharing information  and increasing  transparency.   Participants were 
encouraged  to communicate the message they took away from the training to non-trained fellow 
farmers from their RPO upon return.  One part of the train- ing was to put together a plan for how 
these messages can be communicated  and discussed with other group members.
The training sessions were organized in three modules, one for each day:  (1) the potential and 
pitfalls of collective commercialization, (2) coordination  within organizations—the role of  
communication  in collective  commercialization, and
(3) motivation for coordination—members and leaders.'⁶  An endline survey was conducted 2 to 4 
weeks after the training.
In this paper we focus on estimating immediate effects of the intervention  on intra-group 
relations. We do not capture long-term effects which would also have been interesting  considering  
that trust  may need time to grow.  We cannot fully preclude a courtesy  bias, i.e., that the 
respondents  give the socially desirable an- swer when reporting higher trust levels after the 
intervention.  However,  baseline and endline data were collected via independent interviewers.  
They were not per- ceived as being related to GRET and PINORD,  the organizations  implementing the 
training,  and were ignorant  of  the treatment  status of RPOs  as well as indi- viduals.  This 
separation of implementation and data collection should  minimize the risk of a courtesy  bias.  If 
we found a spillover effect on trust of non-invited individuals  in treated  RPOs,  we would be 
even less concerned  about a courtesy bias.  Indeed, our findings suggest that the intervention  
had an impact on trust of non-invited  individuals  (see Section 6), thus mitigating concerns  
related to such
’⁵See Appendix  B.1 for  more  details  on  the  one-sided  noncompliance.   The  distribution  of 
RPOs  and  farmers  by  intended  and  actual  treatment  status  as  shown  in  Tables  B.1 and  
B.2  in Appendix B.1 underline that treatment assignment is balanced which we further assess in 
Table 4.

To ensure that the assignment  of the treatment is independent of any baseline characteristics,  we 
 run  a series  of  balancing  tests  relating  RPO's  invitations  to participate in the training 
to individual and RPO-level characteristics. In Table 4 we report means of individual and RPO-level 
characteristics in invited and non- invited RPOs at baseline as well as results from two-sample t 
tests with the null of equal means in invited and non-invited RPOs.  Results suggest that the 
treatment
17



allocation is fully independent  of  average baseline  trust levels,¹⁷ and a range of further  
covariates.   Treatment  and  control  group  only  differ  significantly  with respect to the 
average walking distance of the farmers to the RPO's storage site.¹⁸ Multivariate tests for 
equality of means of baseline trust in invited and non-invited groups reveal no significant 
differences between  treatment  and control groups.¹⁹ Within invited RPOs, we find no significant 
differences in average baseline trust when comparing invitees and non-invitees  (see Table 5 for 
details on binary trust measures and Table B.4 in Appendix B.2 for details on ordinal trust 
measures).

4    Experimental  design
4.1    Hypotheses
Ostrom and Ahn (2003) provide a theoretical  framework for analyzing issues of collective action 
which can be applied to analyzing collective commercialization as an example of collective action.  
Success and failure of collective action is de- termined by a complex configuration  of various 
factors which they categorize as forms  of  social  capital.   They  argue  that  the different  
forms  of  social  capital— trustworthiness,  networks and institutions—enhance trust  which they  
see as the core link  between  social capital  and collective  action.  Figure  2 shows the rela- 
tionships between the forms of social capital, trust, and collective action.

Trust reduces opportunistic behavior and, thus, transaction costs (Collier, 2002; Putnam, 1993).  
Applied to the context of collective commercialization in RPOs, farmers  who are organized in RPOs 
need to be trustworthy  and sufficiently  con- nected  with each other,  and  the RPO needs  to 
provide  adequate institutions  for trust to be prevalent  within  the RPO and for collective  
commercialization to be successful.  Trust in leaders allows the trusting farmer to commit to 
commercial- ization despite the risk of loss if the leaders do not behave as the trusting farmer 
expected.  Trust in members allows the trusting farmer to commit to commercial- ization despite the 
risk of loss if the fellow farmers do not participate in the joint endeavors as expected by the 
trusting farmer.
If  the training  intervention  increases  the different  forms  of  social capital,  it

20



will enhance trust and ultimately lead to more successful collective commercial- ization and 
potentially other collective endeavors in treated RPOs. Putnam (1993) distinguishes between 
horizontal networks bringing together individuals of equiv- alent status, e.g. fellow members or 
fellow leaders, and vertical networks bringing together individuals from different hierarchical  
levels, e.g. members and leaders. Dense  horizontal  networks  with  the capability  of  
efficiently  transmitting  infor- mation  across  individuals  create  incentives  to  behave  in  
a  trustworthy  manner. Repeated  interactions  among  individuals  are  seen  as  a sign  of  
robust  networks (Ostrom  and  Ahn,  2003).   We expect  that  the  training  intervention  
strengthens existing horizontal  and vertical networks and may even create new ones through 
repeated  interactions  of  farmers.   Put  differently,  we expect  the intervention  to have a 
positive effect on participating leaders’ trust in other leaders and on partic- ipating  members’  
trust in other members  through  tightening  existing  bonds  and creating  new ones during  and 
after the joint field trip to the training.  Similarly, in RPOs where both members and leaders 
participate,  the training may increase trust between leaders and members through strengthening 
and/or creating vertical networks. We hypothesize that such increases in social capital will 
materialize in a positive treatment effect on trust in members and on trust in leaders.
Both  networks  and institutions  change the incentive  structure  of  individuals
with institutions creating incentives for both the trusting and the trusted party to behave  in  a  
trustworthy  manner  (Ostrom  and  Ahn,  2003).   We  expect  that  the intervention  clarifies the 
process of collective commercialization as one form of collective action and the rules involved 
and, thus, creates a common understand- ing  of  the relevant  institutions.   In other  words,  
trained  members  (leaders)  may obtain a better understanding of leaders’ (members’) role and 
position which may increase members’ (leaders’) trust in leaders (members) even if no leaders (mem- 
bers)  are  present  during  the training.   Further,  the intervention  may  also create positive 
spillover effects, i.e., increase non-participants’ trust in leaders and mem- bers. Participants 
may convey their newly acquired understanding of leaders’ and members’ role and position to 
non-participants during the general assembly held shortly after the training. We hypothesize that 
such increases in social capital will again  materialize  in a positive treatment  effect on trust 
in members  and on trust in leaders.

4.2    Measures of trust
We  consider  six  survey  measures  of  trust  capturing  different  aspects  of  trust within  a  
RPO  that  we  consider  to  be  important  for  successful  collective  com- mercialization. We 
distinguish between trust in leaders and trust in members.
Measuring general trust²⁰ in unknown others based on the standard trust ques- tion used in the 
General Society Survey (GSS)²¹ or the World Values Survey²² has been challenged on the grounds that 
it is unclear what this question actually mea- sures  (Beugelsdijk,  2006;  Durlauf,  2002; Sobel,  
2002;  Yamagishi  et al.,  1999). Results from relating general trust in strangers as stated in the 
survey question to behavior in experimental  trust games are mixed.²3
However,  survey  measures  are  commonly  used  for  studying  trust  as  a col- lective property 
of organizations, i.e., for studying trust in known others.  In the management  literature,  the 
perception  of the characteristics of significant  others within the working context is looked at 
for studying trust between and within or- ganizational  levels (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000).  We 
borrow from this lit- erature to asses how characteristics of members and leaders are perceived 
within the RPO context.²⁴ For trust in leaders, we distinguish  between trust in their mo- tives 
and trust  in their competence  with regard  to collective  commercialization. Trust  in leaders'  
motives  refers  to a farmer's  beliefs  that  the leaders  are  other- regarding or not, i.e., 
that the leaders have motives to perform an action beneficial to others or not. Trust in leaders'  
competence refers to a farmer's beliefs that the leaders have credible expertise  (Buck and Alwang, 
 2011; Twyman  et a1., 2008).
20General trust is a baseline expectation of others' trustworthiness (Yamagishi, 2001).
²'“Generally  speaking,  would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too 
careful in dealing with people?”—“Most people can be trusted.”  or “Can't be too careful.”
22  Generally  speaking,  would  you say that most  people can be trusted  or that you  need to be
very careful in dealing with people?”—“Most people can be trusted.” or “Need to be very careful.” 
²³Glaeser et al. (2000) find in a sample of students at Harvard University that trust as stated in 
the survey  has no predictive power for trust elicited from the trust game, but for 
trustworthiness. For a representative sample of the German  population,  Fehr et al. (2002) find a 
relation of  trust as  measured  in  the  survey  and  experimental  trust,  but  not for  
trustworthiness.   Sapienza  et  al. (2007)  find  that  trust  as  stated  in  the  survey  
predicts  experimental  trust  for  a  sample  of  MBA students at the University of Chicago.  For 
a heterogeneous  Dutch sample, Bellemare and Kroger (2007)  find  no significant  link  between  
trust  as  measured  in  the survey  to neither experimental trust nor trustworthiness. Naef and 
Schupp (2009) have developed a new survey measure for trust in strangers  that is  more  precise  
that  the GSS  question  and  have  used  it in  the  German  Socio-
Economic  Panel  showing  that  survey  and  experimental  measures  of  trust  are  connected  in  
the sense that the trust game measures trust in strangers.
²⁴See Kramer (1999) and Mollering  et al. (2004) for reviews of the conceptualization of trust in 
organizational theory and the benefits of and conditions for trust in organizational systems. See 
Seppanen et al. (2007) for a review of the empirical research of inter-organizational trust.

We consider four aspects of  trust in leaders  asking  respondents  to which extent they agree with 
the following statements:
(1)  “The RPO's  board  is capable  of  negotiating  better prices for our  produce than I am 
capable of myself.”
(2)  “Board members defend the RPO's interests and their own interests in equal measure.”
(3)  “If  the RPO's  board  says that I can achieve  better prices if  I wait a little, they do so 
because they have adequate information.”
(4)  “If I invest my money or my produce in the RPO, it will be used efficiently.”
For trust in members,  we consider both general trust and trust specific to the farming context 
asking respondents to which extent they agree with the following statements:
(5)  “The majority of people in my RPO are trustworthy.”

(6)  “I can trust the people from the RPO to look after my field during  an ab- sence of two 
months.”
Originally,  all trust measures  are recorded  on a four-point Likert-type  scale. The items to 
choose from are (1) “Do not agree at all”, (2) “Do not really agree”,
(3) “Agree”,  and (4) “Fully agree”.  However,  given that the average trust levels at baseline are 
well above 3 for all measures of trust (see Table B.4 in Appendix B.2), we use binary  variables  
as regressands  in the empirical analysis  which are equal to one if respondents fully agree with 
one of the above statements.
Hence, for trust in leaders, we create a binary variable negotiation equal to one if the respondent 
fully agrees  with the first statement,  a binary  variable integrity equal to one if  the 
respondent  fully  agrees  with the second  statement,  a binary variable  information  equal  to  
one  if  the  respondent  fully  agrees  with  the  third statement,  and  a binary  variable  
efficienc y equal  to one if  the respondent  fully agrees with the fourth statement. For trust in 
members, we create a binary variable general equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the 
fifth statement, and a binary variable jarring equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the 
sixth statement.
Moreover,  we create two comprehensive  indices  of  trust.  For trust_sum  we take  the  sum  over 
 the  six  binary  trust  measures  such  that  values  of  trust_sum
23



range from 0 to 6.²⁵ For trust factor we run a factor analysis with the six binary trust measures.  
Values of the resulting index of trust range from -1.74 to 0.81.²⁶

5    Treatment effects at RPO level
In  this  section  we  present  our empirical  strategy  and  regression  results  for  the causal 
treatment effects of the (invitation to the) training on average trust.

Notes:  We report averages of different trust measures in treatment group (T—treatment  group)  and 
control  group (C— control group) at baseline (BL—baseline)  and endline (EL—endline)  as well as 
p-values of two-sample  t tests with  the null of equal means.


Descriptive evidence suggests a positive impact of the training intervention on intra-RPO  trust.  
Table 6 reports two-sample t tests with the null of equal means in  baseline  and  endline  for  
treatment  and  control  group.   Moreover,  we  report two-sample t tests with the null of equal 
means for treatment and control group in both baseline and endline.  Treatment RPOs report higher 
levels of average trust
25iru5i_sHm has a mean of 4.08 and a standard deviation of 2.35.
26trust factor has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

at endline compared to baseline for all measures of trust. We observe statistically significant  
differences  between  average  trust  in  leaders'  negotiation  skills  and their informational  
advantages.  While we find no significant differences between average trust  in treatment  and 
control group at baseline,  treatment  RPOs report significantly  higher levels of trust at endline 
compared  to control  RPOs for trust in leaders'  negotiation skills and their integrity,  for 
general and farming-specific trust in members, and for both comprehensive  trust indices.²⁷

5.1    Empirical strategy
To further study the intervention's impact on trust, we estimate treatment effects on RPO level. To 
account for the one-sided noncompliance²⁸ that may be related to individual  and  RPO-level  
characteristics,  we first  present  estimations  of  the intention-to-treat effect,  i.e.,  the 
treatment  effect  of  the invitation  to participate in  the training  intervention.   We draw  on 
 the random  assignment  of  the invita- tions (and the time dimension of our data) to identify the 
causal effect of such an invitation at the RPO level on our different measures of trust.
In our main regressions  we will allow for fixed effects to pick up differences in unobservable 
characteristics between individuals and/or RPOs. Although treat- ment  was  randomly  assigned,  
the relatively  small  number  of  RPOs  may  entail some small sample imbalances in observed 
and/or unobserved characteristics. To be on the safe side, we include fixed effects.  Since our 
analysis is based on two time periods, fixed effects regressions are identical to taking first 
differences in a regression with no further covariates.²⁹ Thus, we estimate:

(1)

where  Atrust    ——  trush ,_t     trust„,q₀ is the difference between average trust
²⁷For descriptive evidence on the intervention's impact on ordinal trust measures see Table B.4 in 
Appendix B.2.
28Participation in the training  intervention  was voluntary  among  those who  were invited,  but
no one from the control RPOs had access to the training intervention.  For details on the one-sided 
noncompliance  see Appendix B.1.
²’Double differencing not only removes biases in an endline comparison between the treatment and 
control  group resulting from permanent differences,  but also biases from a comparison  over time 
in the treatment  group resulting from time trends that are unrelated  to the intervention.  The 
key identifying  assumption  (common  trend assumption)  for the estimation of a causal treatment 
effect is that trends in development of trust would on average be the same in treatment and control 
groups in the absence of the training intervention (Imbens and Wooldridge,  2009).

in RPO p at endline 1     1 and baseline I =  0 and  RPO  invitation   is a binary variable equal 
to one if at least one member or leader of RPO p has received  an invitation  to participate in the 
training intervention.   v, is a random  disturbance term for RPO p.  Given  the random assignment  
of  the invitations,  the estimated coefficient      is our main coefficient of interest, the 
causal effect of the invitation to the  training  on  average  trust.   It captures  both  the  
treatment  effect  for those individuals  who have personally  been invited (direct  treatment  
effect) and those who have only been interviewed  (spillover effect)  which  we will disentangle  
in Section 6.
For illustrative  purposes,  we  also report  results  of  level  regressions,  i.e.,  of 
regressions  without fixed effects.  Using endline data, we estimate the following linear model:

(2)

where  true „‹-   is  a  measure  of  average  trust  in RPO  p at endline  t  =  1 and 
fififi_tnrttatiou, is defined as above.  Hence,  fit  is our main coefficient  of in- terest in 
this model,  the average causal effect of the invitation to the training  on average trust. e   is 
a random disturbance term for RPO p.
To  address  concerns  with  regard  to  statistical  inference  in  the  small  cross- section 
sample of 73 RPOs, we provide both OLS standard errors and classical in- ference as well as 
randomization  inference. For the intention-to-treat estimations based  on  equations  (1)  and  
(2),  we  implement  permutation  tests  which  do  not rely on asymptotic approximation and whose 
properties are hence independent of sample size.'⁰  Randomization  inference is based on the sharp 
null hypothesis of no treatment  effect for anybody  and provides exact finite sample inference.  
We conduct randomization inference by forming 9000 randomly drawn permutations of the randomization 
 vector for the 73 RPOs and calculating the regression esti- mates using regressions  as presented 
in equations (1) and (2).  For each outcome of interest, this provides the finite sample 
distribution of the estimated  treatment effect under the null of no effect, upon which we base our 
two-sided test of zero effect.   For  recent  applications  of  this  approach  see  for  example  
Bloom  et  a1.
*⁰Randomization  inference is typically  only done for intention-to-treat estimations.  Random- 
ization inference in the instrumental variable regression context would required modeling assump- 
tions since the compliance type is not known for all observations,  i.e. the counterfactual value 
of RPO    troininp if ISO     inritotion was changed.


26



(2013) and Landmann and Frolich (2015).
In next step, we estimate the effect of treatment on the treated, i.e., the causal effect of the 
training intervention  on those who participated,  using the randomly assigned  invitations  as  an 
 instrumental  variable  for  training  received.   We esti- mate:

(3)
(4)

where  RPO_training    is  a  binary  variable  equal  to one  if  at  least  one  mem- ber or 
leader  of  RPO  p participated  in the training  which  we instrument  for by RPG_inritation  . 
The first stage regression coefficient is 0.88.  Since both the treatment  variable  and  the  
instrument  are  binary,  the  instrumental  variable  re- gression is identical to the Wald (or 
LATE) estimator.  The estimated effects are identical  to those of equations  (1) and (2) divided  
by 0.88.  We therefore  report randomization  inference  only  for  the  reduced  form  
regressions,  estimates  only differ  by  this  scaling  factor.   The  F statistic  from  the  
first-stage  regressions  is 351.60, the adjusted fi² is 0.6937.  trust, ,_t  and fitrust, are 
defined as above. c,  and in,  are random  disturbance  terms  for RPO  p.  Thus,  the estimated  
coef- ficients      and      are our  main  coefficients  of  interest,  the causal effects  of  
the training on average trust in those RPOs who participated.

5.2    Regression results
In Table 7 we report estimated  treatment effects on average trust.  In panel A we report  results  
from  regressions  using  endline  data  while  panel  B  shows  results from first differences 
estimations.  We present intention-to-treat effects based on reduced  form  regressions  as 
specified  in equations  (1) and  (2),  and  we present treatment  on  the  treated  effects  based 
 on  instrumental  variable  regressions  as specified in equations (3) and (4).
The regression results confirm the descriptive evidence  presented above.  An invitation  to the  
training  significantly  increases  both  comprehensive  trust  mea- sures.  The estimated  
treatment  effect  becomes  even larger  when  looking  at the effect of the training itself on 
average trust. In detail, we find a significantly  pos- itive intention-to-treat effect of between 
11 and 13 percentage points for average trust in leaders'  negotiation  skills,  their integrity  
and their informational  advan-

27



tage."  We further find a significantly positive intention-to-treat effect of between 10 and 13 
percentage  points for both measures of trust in members.  These posi- tive treatment effects 
increase to 12 to 15 percentage points when considering the effect of the training itself.
We run several robustness  checks to confirm  these results.  First, we enlarge the model in first 
differences by allowing for onion-specific and rice-specific time trends  and  by controlling  for 
the number  of  invited/trained persons  per RPO.³° Qualitatively,  results  remain  unchanged  
compared  to  the  model  in  first  differ- ences without covariates.  Second,  we follow  
McKenzie  (2012) who argues that large improvements  in power can arise when estimating  treatment  
effects via an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) estimation compared to using the difference- 
in-differences  specification.   We  estimate  the  ANCOVA  specifications  without covariates,  
with controls for onion and rice cultivation  and with a control for the number of invited/trained 
persons per RPO. Results are similar to those from the difference-in-differences estimations and 
robust to controlling for onion and rice cultivation  and to controlling  for the number of 
invitees/participants.  For details on these robustness checks see Appendix B.3.



















*'Recall that baseline trust averages range between 0.63 for trust in leaders’  negotiation skills 
and general trust in members and 0.71 for trust in leaders’ integrity (see Table 4.)
’²Note that when including covariates to the model in first differences, it is no longer equivalent 
to a fixed effects model.

6    Treatment effects at individual level
In this section  we present  treatment  effects of  the (invitation  to the) training  on trust 
based on individual-level regressions permitting us to disentangle the effect of having personally 
been invited from a potential spillover effect on non-invited farmers  within  treated  RPOs.  We 
start  by  assessing  descriptively  whether  trust has evolved  between  the baseline and endline 
survey and whether it has evolved differently  in  treatment  and  control  groups.   Table  5  
reports  two-sample  t tests with the null of equal means in baseline and endline for invitees, 
non-invitees in invited RPOs and for non-invitees in non-invited RPOs. Moreover, we report two- 
sample t tests with the null of equal means for invitees and non-invitees in invited RPOs in both 
baseline and endline and for non-invitees in invited and non-invited RPOs in both baseline and 
endline. Invitees report higher levels of trust at endline compared  to  baseline  for  all  
measures  for trust.   This  difference  is  statistically significant for all measures except for 
trust in leaders' integrity.  Further indication of a positive direct treatment  effect comes from 
the comparison  of invitees with non-invitees  from invited  RPOs.  While  we observe  no 
significant  difference  at baseline,  we observe  significant  differences  for all  measures  of  
trust  in  leaders but negotiation at endline.  We also find descriptive evidence for a positive 
spill- over effect within invited RPOs.  Comparing  non-invitees  from invited and non- invited 
RPOs, we find no significant differences at baseline. At endline, however, non-invitees  in invited 
 RPOs  report  significantly  higher  trust  levels  for all trust measures but efficienc y 
compared to non-invitees from non-invited RPOs.

6.1    Empirical strategy
To further study spillover effects and direct treatment effects, we estimate:





where  fitrust„        tr ust„ ,_t      kms!,  ,‹-   is  the  difference  between  trust  of person 
i in RPO p at endline I =  1 and baseline t =  0, spillover_incitation,  is a binary  variable 
equal to one if some member or leader from RPO p other than person  i  has  received  an  
invitation,  personal   invitation,  is  a  binary  variable equal  to one if  person  (  has  
received  an invitation  to participate  in  the training

30



intervention,  and  r„   is  a  random  disturbance  term  for  individual  i  in  RPO  p. Hence, 
the estimated coefficient ct  captures any potential spillover effects while 2 captures the effect 
of having personally been invited.
Again, we also estimate the causal effect of the training using an instrumental
variable strategy. We estimate:



where  spillover_training,   is  a  binary  variable  equal  to  one  if  some  member or  leader  
from  RPO  p  other  than  person  i  has  participated  in  the  training  and personal_training,  
is  a  binary  variable  equal  to  one  if  person  i  has  partici- pated  in  the training  
intervention.   We instrument  for spi//orer_tra?Hf Hp„  and personal   trnininp,  using  RPG    
inritntton,  and personal  inritotion,.”  The F  statistic  from  the  first-stage  regression  of  
spillover_!roining,   amounts  to 174.18,  the  adjusted  fi²  to  0.6062.   For  persona/   
/raininp,  the  F  statistic  is
240.95  and the adjusted  fi² is 0.6403.  a„  is a random  disturbance  term for in- dividual  i  
in  RPO  p,  and  fitrust„  is  defined  as  above.   Hence,  the  estimated coefficient 8t  
captures any potential spillover effects while 32 captures the effect of having personally been 
trained.
To  gain  further  insights  into  spillover  effects,  we  also  estimate  regressions as 
specified  in equation  (6) separately  for subsamples  containing  only  members or  only  
leaders.   For  the  subsample  of  members,  we further  split  the  spillover effect by treatment 
 type, i.e., by whether only members  were treated, only lead- ers,  or both.   In  these  
regressions,  we instrument  for  spillorer_!rainrug,   and personnl_trnininp, by fifiO_inritatton, 
and  personol_ini:iIation .'⁴  We in- strument for spi/lorer_tratninp  fi L,p, spillorer_tratninp  
OM,p, spillorer_ trnininp   LM,  and persona/   training, using  RPO   invitation  GT   , RPG
?ft F?/O/f.OTt_OM„ R PO_invitation.  LMS and personal_invi/ation;. The highly
significant correlation coefficients range between -0.2863 and 0.9021.
33The  highly   significant   correlation   coefficients   are  0.5702  for   spill over_training   
and RPO   inritotion,    0.2700   for    personal   trnininp   and   ISO     inritotion,    -0.3509 
  for personal   inritot/on   and   spill over  traiu/np   and   0.7993   for   personal

6.2    Regression results
In Table 8 we report estimated  treatment  effects on individual  trust.  We present 
intention-to-treat effects based on reduced form regressions as specified in equa- tion (5), and 
results from instrumental  variable estimations  as specified in equa- tion  (6).   Results  hint  
at  a significantly  positive  treatment  effect  of  having  per- sonally received an invitation.  
In detail, we find a significant personal intention- to-treat effect of 13 to 20 percentage points 
for all individual  trust measures  but trust in leaders'  negotiation skills.'⁵ These effects 
increase to 15 to 24 percentage points when considering  the treatment effect of the training.
To gain further insights into spillover effects and direct treatment effects, we rerun  estimations 
 as  specified  in equations  (5)  and  (6)  on  subsamples  contain- ing only members or only 
leaders.  Results are presented in Tables 9 (members) and  10  (leaders).   In  Table  9 we  
present  intention-to-treat  effects  based  on  re- duced form regressions  on a subsample  of 
members as specified in equation  (5) and  results from instrumental  variable estimations  on  a 
subsample  of  members as specified  in equation  (6).  For members  we find both  a significantly  
positive personal  treatment  effect  as  well  as a  significantly  positive  spillover  effect.   
In particular,  we find significantly  positive direct treatment  effects of  19 to 20 per- centage 
points for trust in leaders'  integrity and their informational advantage as well as a significant  
personal intention-to-treat effect of 18 percentage points on general  trust and farming  specific  
trust in members.  For trust  in leaders'  nego- tiation  skills,  their  integrity,  and  their  
informational  advantages,  results  appear to  be indicating  a  significantly  positive  
spillover  effect  of  15  to  16  percentage points.  This may be attributed  to untrained members 
 believing that trained lead- ers have gained relevant skills (trust in competence)  and that 
trained leaders are less  likely  to  privately  capture  rents  (trust  in  motives).   We  
further  split  these spillover effects into spillovers in RPOs where only leaders were invited 
(partic- ipated), RPOs where only members were invited (participated) and RPOs where both leaders 
and members were invited (participated). Results presented in Table 9 hint at the spillover effects 
in trust in leaders being most pronounced in RPOs where either only leaders or only members were 
invited (participated). Given the small sample size in the subsample  containing only leaders 
(N=168),  results for this subsample present inconclusive (see Table 10).
3⁵The  average  baseline  trust levels  range from 0.62 for general  trust  in  members  to 0.71 
for trust in leaders'  integrity.

Notes:  The number of invited/trained persons in treated RPOs ranges from  2 to 16.  Hence,  it is 
impossible  to be the only invited/treated person in a treated RPO. We report  coefficients  from 
regressions  using  both  baseline  and endline  data regressing  changes  in trust  on a constant, 
 a  binary  indicator  for personal  treatment and a binary indicator for treatment of others.  For 
instrumental  variable regressions  we report coefficients from two-stage estimations  using  RPO  
invitation and personal   inritotion as instruments for spillover  brain in g and personal  brain 
in g. Standard errors are reported in parentheses (clustered at RPO level).

We  run  similar  robustness  checks  on  the full  sample  of  798 farmers  as  we did for the 
treatment  effects  on  RPO level.  First,  we enlarge  the model  in first differences  by  
allowing  for  onion-specific  and  rice-specific  time  trends  and  by controlling for the number 
of invited/trained persons per RPO. Qualitatively, re- sults  remain  unchanged  compared  to the  
model  in first differences  without  co- variates.  Second,  we estimate ANCOVA  specifications 
without covariates,  with controls  for  onion  and  rice  cultivation  and  with  controlling  for 
 the  number  of invited/trained persons per RPO. Results are similar to those from the difference- 
in-differences estimations and robust to controlling for onion and rice cultivation and  to 
controlling  for  the number  of  invitees/participants.   For details  on  these robustness 
checks, see Appendix B.4.
Besides  having  an impact  on intra-RPO  trust  in both  members  and  leaders, the training 
intervention may have also affected farmers' perception of their RPO. Data about the true and 
perceived level of  information  is scarce in our data set. We have information on how well farmers 
know their own RPO, namely whether they believe to know how many members their RPO has. This 
question was only included in the endline survey.  In Table 11 we report the percentage of farmers 
stating  that  they  know  the size of  their  RPO  by  intended  treatment  status.   On average,  
farmers from invited  RPOs feel significantly  better informed  about the size of their RPO than 
farmers in the control group. This difference is dominated by farmers who were personally invited, 
but also non-invited farmers in the treat- ment group fare better than farmers in the control 
group.  Apparently, the training was able  to provide farmers  with information  they  were 
previously  lacking.  In line with this, we find that farmers in invited RPOs appear better 
informed about the potential benefits of an efficiently working RPO, and also a significant differ- 
ence when looking at the evaluation of the actual RPOs (see Table 11).  Farmers from invited RPOs 
are significantly  more confident than farmers from the control group that their RPO can help to 
overcome hindrances  that they encounter when selling individually.

in  panels B and C are smaller  than  the sample in  panel  A as people who stated to not be facing 
any constraints  when selling individually  did not answer these questions.

7    Concluding remarks
Although many positive examples from both developed and developing countries exist,  many  RPOs  
still  struggle  to offer  the type of  commercialization services that would lead to higher output 
prices for their members.  In this paper, we have argued that trust in leaders'  motives and 
competence as well as trust in members are  crucial  for  successful  collective  commercialization 
 as  a form  of  collective action.
We conduct  a cluster-randomized controlled  trial in  the context  of  RPOs  in Senegal.  We 
randomly  invited  members  and/or leaders to participate in a three- day training to induce 
members and leaders to coordinate towards successful col- lective commercialization.  The training 
itself  consisted  of three days of interac- tive discussion on the benefits, conduct and 
constraints of collective commercial- ization.  In all treated  RPOs,  a general  assembly  was 
convened  shortly  after the training to discuss its content with non-participants.
We find a positive treatment effect of the training on both trust in leaders and trust  in  
members.   For  trust  in  leaders,  the  effect  is  especially  pronounced  for trust  in  
leaders'  integrity  and  their  informational  advantage.   Moreover,  results suggest a strong 
spillover effect on non-treated members for trust in leaders, i.e., that the sizable positive  
average treatment  effect is not to be attributed  solely to personal  invitation.  This may  be 
attributed  to untrained  members  believing  that

trained leaders have gained relevant skills (trust in competence)  and that trained leaders are 
less likely  to privately capture rents (trust in motives).  These results are robust to the 
inclusion of different covariates and to different specifications of the underlying model.
These findings  suggest  that relatively  soft and non-costly  interventions  such as a group 
training appear to be able to positively affect intra-RPO  trust and the farmer's perception of 
coordination towards successful collective action. Further- more,  social  capital  is  often  
thought  to increase  with  use,  i.e.,  it is  thought  of as being self-reinforcing when  
reciprocity  connects  people leading  to increased trust and confidence  (Pretty and Ward,  2001). 
 Thus, the training  may  well have been  the  starting  point  for  more  collective  endeavors  
to  come.   Bernard  et  al. (2014) show for a subsample of groundnut farmers that the training 
intervention indeed  had a positive  effect  on  the quantity  of  produce commercialized collec- 
tively through the RPOs.  While being the motivation for this research, collective 
commercialization is only one dimension  along  which smallholders  can  benefit from  the training 
intervention.  Smallholders  can benefit from  the newly  gained intra-RPO trust in many ways; RPOs 
also engage in various other joint activities aside from collective  commercialization all of  
which require  trust among  mem- bers and leaders.  For example,  RPOs lend farming equipment  or 
provide credit to their members.  In case of  the rice farmers,  there is good case to believe  
that they benefit from increased trust when jointly managing irrigation systems. With 
well-developed social capital,  local  water-users’  groups  are able to use existing resources 
more efficiently than individuals  working alone or in competition.  The same holds true for forest 
management practiced by some RPOs (Pretty and Ward, 2001).

B    Supplementary analyses
In this appendix  we provide  additional  analyses  on selected  issues  discussed  in the paper.

B.1    One-sided noncompliance
While invitations  were distributed according  to the randomization  protocol, one- sided 
noncompliance  regarding  training  participation  was frequent.  While none of the control RPOs 
participated in the training, some of the invited RPOs chose not  to participate.   From  those  
RPOs  that  did  participate,  not  always  the exact farmers  that had personally  been invited  
to the training  participated,  sometimes others came to the training instead.  In the empirical 
analysis, we deal with this by estimating intention-to-treat effects, i.e. the treatment effect of 
the invitation, and by estimating  treatment effects of the training by instrumenting for the 
participa- tion using the invitation as instrument.  Tables B.1 and B.2 provide details on the 
one-sided noncompliance.
In Table B.1 we provide details based on the distribution of invitations  while we consider  actual 
 participation  in  the  training  in  Table  B.2.   In  Table  B.1  we report the intended 
distribution of 798 interviewed farmers from 73 RPOs on 50 invited and 23 non-invited RPOs, and the 
intended distribution of 597 interviewed farmers from 50 invited RPOs on 150 invitees and 447 
non-invitees.  Further, we report  how  the invitations  were allocated  to RPOs in  which  only  
leaders  (OL), only members (OM), or both leaders and members (LM) were invited. We report both the 
number of farmers and the number of RPOs (in parentheses).
In Table B.2 we report the actual distribution of 798 interviewed farmers from 73 RPOs  on  44  
treated  and  23  non-treated  RPOs,  and  the  distribution  of  534 interviewed  farmers  from  
44 treated  RPOs  on 142 trained  and  392 non-trained farmers. Further, we report how the 
participation was allocated to RPOs in which only leaders (OL), only members (OM), or both leaders 
and members (LM) were trained. We report both the number of farmers and the number of RPOs (in 
paren- theses).

B.2    Descriptive statistics for ordinal measures of trust
Originally,  responses  to all trust survey  questions  were recorded  on a four-point Likert-type  
scale.   The  items  to choose  from  are  (1)  “Do  not agree  at all”,  (2) “Do not really  
agree”,  (3) “Agree”,  and (4) “Fully  agree”.  However,  given  that the average trust levels at 
baseline are well above 3 for all measures of trust, we use binary  variables  as regressands  in 
the empirical  analysis  which are equal to one if respondents  fully agree with one of the asked 
statements.  Here, we report additional descriptive statistics for trust measures using the 
original coding.
In Table B.3 we show that the assignment of the invitations is also independent of ordinal  trust  
measures  at baseline.  The two-sample  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  tests with the null of equal means in 
control and treatment groups at baseline reveal no significant differences.

Descriptive  statistics  reveal  a positive  impact of  the intervention  on ordinal measures of 
trust.  In Table B.4 we report results of two-sample Wilcoxon rank- sum tests with the null of 
equal means in ordinal trust in baseline and endline for invitees, non-invitees in invited RPOs and 
for non-invitees in non-invited  RPOs. Moreover,  we report two-sample Wilcoxon  rank-sum tests 
with the null of equal means in ordinal trust for invitees and non-invitees in invited RPOs in both 
base- line  and  endline  and  for  non-invitees  in  invited  and  non-invited  RPOs  in  both 
baseline  and endline.  Results are similar to those  when using binary trust mea- sures  (see 
Table 5).  Invitees report higher levels of trust at endline compared  to baseline  for  all  
ordinal  measures  for  trust.   Further  indication  of  a  positive  di-

rect  treatment  effect  comes  from  the  comparison  of  invitees  with  non-invitees from 
invited  RPOs.  While  we observe  no significant  difference  at baseline,  we observe significant 
differences for all ordinal measures of trust in leaders but ne- gotiation_ordinal  at  endline.   
We  also  find  descriptive  evidence  for  a  positive spill-over  effect within invited RPOs.  
Comparing  non-invitees  from invited and non-invited RPOs, we find no significant differences at 
baseline. At endline, how- ever,  non-invitees  in invited  RPOs report  significantly  higher 
trust levels for all ordinal trust measures but efficienc y  ordinal compared to non-invitees from 
non- invited RPOs.

B.3    Robustness checks for treatment effects on RPO level
We run several robustness checks to confirm our main findings reported in Section

First, we enlarge the model in first differences  (see equations (1) and (4)) by allowing for 
onion-specific and rice-specific  time trends  (see Table B.5) and by controlling for the number of 
invited/trained persons per RPO (see Table B.6).³⁶ Table B.5 shows results for regressing changes 
in trust on a binary treatment in- dicator, a binary indicator for rice cultivation,  a binary 
indicator for onion culti- vation and a constant.  We report both intention-to-treat effects as 
well as results from  two-stage  regressions  using invitation  status  as an instrument  for 
training participation. We use RPLC   tn uttatton as instrument for RPO  training in Ta- ble B.S.   
The  highly  significant  correlation  coefficient  between  these  two  vari- ables  amounts  to 
0.8354.  Qualitatively, results  remain  unchanged  compared  to the model in first differences  
without covariates.  We find a significantly  positive treatment  effect of the training of 12 to 
13 percentage points on trust in leaders' integrity and their informational  advantage. For the 
reduced form regressions, we provide  conventional  inference  and randomization  inference.   We 
find  a similar pattern as we did in our main analysis,  p-values for the randomization  inference 
are smaller  than those for the conventional  inference for all regressions.  Hence, for reasons of 
clarity,  we refrain from presenting  randomization  inference in the following.
Table B.6 shows results for regressing changes in trust on a binary treatment
indicator, the number of invited farmers and a constant.  We also run a specifica- tion where we 
consider the number of invited members and the number of invited leaders.  Again,  we report  both 
intention-to-treat effects  as well as results from two-stage regressions using invitation status 
as an instrument for training partici- pation. We use RPO  invitation and n umber_inri!ed  as 
instruments for RPO_trained  and numher_trained  (highly significant  correlation  coefficients 
range between 0.6467 and 0.9054) as well as fififi_tnrttation, number_inri!ed_ members and 
number_inrited_l eader s as instruments for RPO_trained, HUW$Cf_tFOf R.Cd_members and 
number_tfOf.HHd_leaders in Table B.6 (highly significant  correlation  coefficients  between  
0.2458  and  0.9045).   Qualitatively, results  remain  unchanged  compared  to  our  main  
results.    The  number  of  in-

to a fixed effects model.

vited/trained  persons  has  no  additional  effect  on  trust  outcomes  on  top  of  the effect 
of the binary treatment measure.  We find a significantly  positive intention- to-treat effect of 
14 to 16 percentage points on trust in leaders' integrity and their informational advantage.

Notes:  We report coefficients  trom regressions  using  both  baseline  and endline  data 
regressing  changes  in mist on a constant,  a  binary  treatment  indicator  and controls  tor the 
number of farmers  (members and  leaders)  invited.   For instrumental  variable  regressions  we 
report  coefficients  from  two-stage  estimations  using  ft P  O_*nr*t ati on and  n umber_énc*t 
ed  as  instruments  for  R  P  O_t   r a i n e d and  no  rn ber_rt   a*n  ed  in  odd-numbered  
columns.   In  even-numbered  columns  we report  coefficients  from  two-stage  estimations  using 
 ftP   O_én c*t at*on,  number_inr*t ed_rn em ber s  and n umber_inc*t ed_f ea d eds as instruments 
for ftP   O_tra*n ed, n umber_tra*n ed_m em bre   s and n'   rn ber_rt   a*n  e d_i ea der s.  
Standard errors are reported in parentheses (clustered at RPO level).

Second,  we follow McKenzie  (2012) who argues that large improvements  in power can arise when 
estimating treatment effects via an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) estimation compared to using 
the difference-in-differences specifica- tion.  While difference-in-differences fully corrects for 
potential  baseline imbal- ances  between  treatment  and  control  groups,  which  may  be 
inefficient  if  base- line data have little predictive  power for future outcomes,  ANCOVA reduces 
the variance  of  the  treatment  effect  estimator  by  conditioning  on  a  variable  that  is 
correlated  with  the outcome  of  interest.   ANCOVA  includes  the mean  value of the outcome 
over all available pre-treatment rounds as a covariate when estimat- ing the treatment effect.  In 
our case of one pre-treatment  and one post-treatment survey, it includes the baseline value of the 
outcome as a covariate.
Thus,  we regress  trust at endline on a constant,  a binary  treatment  indicator and on trust at 
baseline.  We estimate these regressions  without covariates,  with controls  for onion  and  rice 
cultivation  (see Table B.7)  and  with control  for the number of invited/trained persons per RPO 
(see Table B.8).
We use RPO_invi!a!ion as instrument for RPO_!‹•!•!•9    in Table B.7 and RPO  invitation  and  
numher  invited  as  instruments  for  RPG  trntned  and number_!rained in Table B.8.  Results are 
similar to those from the difference-
in-differences  estimations.   Without  covariates,  we  find  a  significantly  positive 
intention-to-treat effect of 10 to 12 percentage points for trust in leaders'  negoti- ation 
skills, their integrity,  and their informational  advantage.  We find a (signifi- cantly) positive 
intention-to-treat effect of 11 percentage points on both measures of  trust in  members.  The 
treatment  effect  of  the training  itself  is again  slightly larger. These results are robust to 
controlling for onion and rice cultivation and to controlling for the number of 
invitees/participants.

B.4    Robustness checks for treatment effects on individual level
To confirm  our main findings  on treatment  effects  on individual  level presented in Section 6, 
we run similar robustness checks as we did for the treatment effects on RPO level.
First, using the full sample of 798 farmers, we enlarge the model in first differ- ences (see 
equations (5) and (6)) by allowing for onion-specific and rice-specific time  trends  (see Table 
B.9) and by controlling  for the number  of  invited/trained persons  per  RPO  (see  Table  
B.10).³⁷   Table  B.9  shows  results  for  regressing changes  in trust on a binary  treatment 
indicator  for personal  treatment,  a binary indicator  for treatment  of  others,  a binary 
indicator  for rice cultivation,  a binary indicator  for onion cultivation  and a constant.  We 
report  both  intention-to-treat effects as well as results from two-stage regressions using 
invitation  status as an instrument for training participation. We instrument for spt/f 
orer_!raining and personnl_trnininp using  RPO_inritation and personn/_tnr(/ntion as instru- 
ments.³'   Qualitatively, results remain  unchanged  compared  to the model in first differences  
without  covariates.   We find  a significantly  positive  effect of  having personally been 
invited of 13 to 18 percentage points on trust in leaders' integrity and their informational  
advantages  as well as on both measures  of trust in mem- bers. The direct treatment effect of the 
training is again slightly larger.
Table B.10 shows results for regressing changes in trust on a binary treatment indicator  for  
personal  treatment,  a  binary  indicator  for  treatment  of  others,  the number of invited 
farmers and a constant.  We report both intention-to-treat effects as well as results from 
two-stage regressions  using invitation  status as an instru- ment for training  participation.  We 
use fiT'O_f HLf tO/tON, TtHTFtber_invited and personal  inri/n/ton  as instruments  for  spillover  
 train(np,  n mutter  trained and  personal_trnininp. The highly significant correlation 
coefficients range be- tween 0.2700 and 0.9004.  Qualitatively, results remain  unchanged  compared 
 to the model in first differences  without covariates.  We find a significantly  positive effect 
of having personally  been invited of 19 to 22 percentage points on trust in leaders'  integrity 
and their informational  advantages  as well as on both measures
3⁷Note that when including covariates to the model in first differences, it is no longer equivalent 
to a fixed effects model.
*⁸The  highly   significant   correlation   coefficients   are  0.5702  for   spill over  training  
 and RPO    invil ation,    0.2700   for    per sonal_traininp   and    RPO  _invi!ation,    
-0.3509   for personal   inritntion   and   spill over  training   and   0.7993   for   per sonal  
inritntion   and



59



of  trust in members.  The direct treatment  effect of  the training is again slightly larger.
Second, we estimate ANCOVA specifications. We regress trust at endline on a constant, a binary 
treatment indicator for personal treatment, a binary indicator for treatment  of  others,  and  on 
trust at baseline.  We estimate these regressions without covariates,  with controls  for onion and 
rice cultivation  (see Table B.11) and with controlling for the number of invited/trained persons 
per RPO (see Ta- ble B.12). In the regressions reported in Table B.11 we use RPO  inri/a/ion and
personaf_inritation as instruments for spillover_Iraininp and personal_traininp. For table B.12 we 
use RPO  ini itotion, mm her  invited and personal  invitation as instruments for 
spillover_traininp, number_trained and personal_traininp.
Results are similar to those from the difference-in-differences estimations.  With- out  
covariates,  we  find  a  significantly  positive  treatment  effect  of  having  per- sonally  
been invited of  13 to 23 percentage  points for all measures  of  trust and indication for a 
spillover effect of 11 to 13 percentage points for trust in leaders' negotiation skills and their 
integrity.  The treatment effect of the training itself is again  slightly  larger.  Results  are 
again  robust  to controlling  for onion  and rice cultivation and to controlling for the number of 
invitees/participants.

Notes:  The number of invited/trained persons in treated RPOs ranges from 2 to 16.  Hence, it is 
impossible  to be the only invited/treated person  in a treated RPO. We report coefficients from 
regressions regressing  trust at endline on a constant, a binary  treatment indicator for personal 
treatment and for treatment of others including  the trust level at baseline as covariate.  In 
panel B we report coefficients from regressions  additionally  including  binary indicators for 
onion and rice cultivation.  For instrumental  variable regressions  we report  coefficients  from 
two-stage  estimations  using  R PO_inri I aI ion and persona/  inr2totzen as instruments for spilt 
over  tra2n2ng and persenof   trozninq. Standard errors are reported in parentheses (clustered at 
RPO level).
