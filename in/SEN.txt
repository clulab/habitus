About Doing Business

The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and selected cities at the subnational and
regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life
cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local firms. It provides quantitative indicators on regulation for
starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of employing workers. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the employing workers indicators or include the topic in the aggregate ease of doing business score or ranking on the ease of doing business, it does
present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and over time, Doing Business encourages
economies to compete towards more efficient regulation; offers measurable benchmarks for reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector
researchers and others interested in the business climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business offers detailed subnational studies, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in different cities and regions within a nation.
These studies provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected
cities can compare their business regulations with other cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The first Doing Business study, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s study covers 11 indicator sets and 190 economies. Most
indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013
(Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business also collected data
for the second largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The project has benefited from
feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide an objective basis for understanding and improving the
regulatory environment for business around the world.

     Starting a Business

This topic measures the number of procedures, time, cost and paid-in minimum capital requirement for a small- to medium-sized limited liability company to start up and
formally operate in each economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically owned, has start-up capital equivalent to
10 times the income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of
operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one
company is owned by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The ranking of economies on the ease of starting a business is determined by sorting their
scores for starting a business. These scores are the simple average of the scores for each of the component indicators.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more information.

Details – Starting a Business in Senegal – Procedure, Time and Cost


No.     Procedures                                                                                              Time to Complete   Associated Costs


1      Deposit the founding capital with a bank                                                                 1 day              included in the following
       Agency : Bank                                                                                                               procedure
       The company can deposit the founding capital with a bank directly (“compte de societe en
       formation”) or through a public notary. The account is liberated once the company is registered at
       the RCCM.

2      Check the company name                                                                                   1 day              no charge

       notary only signs. The involvement of the notary is required.
                                                                                                                                   8,000,000

       The statutes can be drafted either by notarial act or by any other act, provided that the authorized
       signatures are notarized. If by notarial act, the notary must (a) establish the statutes (if the
       promoter has not done so) and issue the declaration of conformity (déclaration de régularité et de
       conformité); and (b) register the statutes and declare the existence of the company with the tax
       authorities.

       The promoter may ask the notary to complete additional formalities, such as commercial
       registration at the court to obtain the company identification number (numéro d'identification
       national des entreprises et des associations, NINEA).

4      Register your business at the one-stop shop                                                              2 days             XOF 25,000 + XOF 30,000
       Agency : One stop-shop                                                                                                      + XOF 90 for any other
       Since November 2007, entrepreneurs can register at the one-stop shop which takes care of what                               XOF 1,000,000 of share
       was formerly done in seven different procedures.
                                                                                                                                   capital

       Four of the procedures are taken care of by having the four relevant agencies dispatch one of
       their civil servants to the one-stop shop. This is:
       • The tax authority to register the bylaws;
       • The Commercial Registry (‘Registre du Commerce et du Credit Mobilier’ - RCCM) to register the
       company bylaws;
       • The NINEA to get a company identification number (‘Numéro d’Identification National des
       Entreprises et des Associations’); and,
       • The Labor authority to register workers and commencement of operation.

       They are all physically located in the same location and there is a timesheet kept by the
       coordinator of the one-stop shop that indicates the precise time with which every person in the
       room delivers the document.

       Another two procedures are handled by the one-stop shop, and these are:
       • Registration at the Social Security (‘Caisse de Securite Sociale’ - CSS);
       • Registration at the Pension Fund (‘Institut de Prevoyance Retraite’ - IPRES).

       These two agencies are not physically located inside the one-stop shop but are a few minutes
       away. What is done is that when a new file comes in, the coordinator of the one-stop shop sends
       the information about the application by email to these two agencies. He then phones them to
       make sure that they received the email. Later in the afternoon (or if it afternoon, the next day), the
       one-stop shop sends a courier to go and fetch the approved documents.

       Fees, for firms with a capital lower than 10,000,000 FCFA, the applicant needs to pay:
       • Registration fees: XOF 25,000 for the statutes
       • Court Registrar fees: XOF 30,000 if the capital is XOF 1 000 000 + XOF 90 for any other XOF
       1,000,000 of capital.


Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

     Dealing with Construction Permits

This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits, submitting all required notifications,
requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building
quality control index, evaluating the quality of building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certification requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more information

                      Agency : Bureau de Control
                      It is rare to receive an inspection from the authorities. Thus, to ensure that building standards are
                      met, BuildCo hires a private inspection agency. Private inspectors visit the site at least once a
                      week to perform technical inspections.

7                     Request final inspection from the Service d'Urbanisme to receive the certificate of                     1 day              XOF 5,500

                      Once construction is completed, BuildCo must fill out a form requesting the certificate of
                      conformity (certificat de conformite). A representative from BuildCo must go to the Service
                      Regional in person with a copy of the authorized plans.

                      Agency : Inspection Agency (Direction Régionale de l’Urbanisme et de l’Architecture)
                      This is an inspection that is done to verify compliance of the construction works with the
                      regulations (prior to issuance of the certificate of conformity). Sometimes companies have to wait
                      2 weeks before receiving this final inspection.

9                     Obtain certificate of conformity                                                                        10 days            XOF 15,000

                      BuildCo must apply for the connection at the private water company, SDE. They lack personnel
                      and so the time to obtain the estimate (devis) for the payment of fees takes about 1 to 2 weeks.

       The application form cost ranges from FCFA 14,000.00 to FCFA 20,000.00. The connection cost is
       around FCFA 115,000.00 for industrial companies. This cost increases if the building is far from
       the nearest source of water.

       The time estimate includes the time to obtain the estimated cost for extension of the grid.

       Agency : Office National d’Assainissement du Sénégal
       BuildCo must visit the sewage company in person to retrieve the inspectors for the inspection of
       the sewage mains. Otherwise, it can take them a few weeks to come. An inspection is necessary
       to obtain the estimate (devis) for the works to be completed.

14     Pay the fees and obtain sewage connection                                                          45 days   XOF 250,000
       Agency : Office National d’Assainissement du Sénégal
       ONAS inspectors prepare the quotation (devis) within a week of inspecting the site. BuildCo must
       then go to ONAS to sign the paperwork and pay the fees. After that, they will install the
       connection. ONAS may sometimes outsource the works to a private company.

        Agency : Electrical Contractor
        The applicant hires an electrical contractor to conduct a technical study of the site and the external
        connection works.

2       Submit application and technical study to Senelec and await approval                                        8 calendar days    XOF 179,000
        Agency : Senelec
        The customer files a request of a new connection to Senelec. As part of the application package
        he/she to submit a copy of his/her identity card, a copy of his/her lease, a copy of the land title and
        the details of the connection. The copies do not have to be notarized. The technical study is also
        sent to Senelec for approval, and they will then need to undertake a site inspection. Moreover,
        Senelec will need to get an authorization from the 'ageroute' at the Ministry of Transport to go over
        the road and make sure there will be sufficient room between the road and the cabling. This
        authorization is an internal process between Senelec and the ageroute. Once the authorization is
        granted and the site is approved by Senelec, the customer is notified by letter.

    3   Receive site inspection by Senelec                                                                          1 calendar day     XOF 0

4       Electrical contractor conducts external connection works and gets approval from Senelec                     32 calendar days   XOF 17,705,000
        Agency : Electrical Contractor
        The electrical contractor that carries out the technical study also orders and purchases the
        necessary material and brings it to the utility for approval. The meter board has to be bought
        directly at Senelec by the customer or the electrical contractor doing the external connection
        works. The transformer has to be bought privately and then be brought to Senelec for a control.

        During the works, the utility will supervise the works. For instance, an initial inspection happens at
        the beginning of the external works. The customer or the electrical contractor has to go to the
        utility after the first inspection to obtain a written note from the utility that confirms the inspection
        (procès verbal). The works in the meantime go on. When the works are finally done, the contractor
        will need to get approval from Senelec via a final inspection.

5       Receive inspection for external works and for electricity turn-on                                           7 calendar days    XOF 0
        Agency : Senelec
        After the external connection works are finished, the electrical contractor writes a letter to Senelec
        and within a week, the utility carries out an inspection of the works. After this, the client can make
        a request for electricity turn-on ('mise sous tension'). Officers from the Senelec from the network
        office (internal division of Senelec) will then come and evaluate the impact of the electricity turn-on
        and assess the length of the necessary power cut (neighbors have to be cut off in order to connect
        the new customer). After this, a date for the electricity turn-on can be scheduled.

6       Pay advance for consumption and await final connection by Senelec                                           14 calendar days   XOF 363,007.75
        Agency : Senelec
        After the final inspection of the external works and the inspection for the electricity turn-on, the
        customer goes to the commercial section of Senelec to pay a the security deposit. The exact
        amount depends on the requested load and the estimated monthly consumption. Once the
        advanced consumption is paid, the utility informs the equipment section and asks them to connect
        the customer. A meeting is held each Tuesday to program cuts, which usually occur on weekends.
        Power is restored once the new connection is made and electricity starts flowing.

     Registering Property

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who wants to purchase land and a
building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality
of land administration index has five dimensions: reliability of infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access
to property rights. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more information.

                   Agency : Land Registry ("Conservation Foncière")
                   This notification allows the State to exercise its preemption rights and possibly to acquire
                   ownership of the property. However, since 2014, the parties do not need to wait until the State
                   notifies whether it exercises its preemption rights to continue with the registration of the property
                   transfer.

                   At the same time, if the Conservation Foncière considers that the property is undervalued, it will
                   request an expert to value the property.

                   The relevant charge is already included in the previous payment to the Notary.

paying taxes and contributions and complying with postfiling procedures (VAT refund and tax audit). The most recent round of data collection for the project was
completed in May 2019 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2018 (January 1, 2018 – December 31, 2018). See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their scores for paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the scores for
each of the component indicators, with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of the component indicators, the total tax and contribution rate. The
threshold is defined as the total tax and contribution rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing
Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total tax and contribution rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business measures the time and cost (excluding
tariffs) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or
importing a shipment of goods. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more information.

    Enforcing Contracts

The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court, and the quality of judicial processes
index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that promote quality and efficiency in the court system. The most recent round of data
collection was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more information.


 What the indicators measure                                             Case study assumptions


Time required to enforce a contract through the courts                  The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a sales contract between two domestic

    Resolving Insolvency

Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are used to calculate the recovery rate,
which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization, liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings.
To determine the present value of the amount recovered by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with
data from central banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit. The most recent round of data collection was completed in May 2019. See the methodology for more
information.


 What the indicators measure                                            Case study assumptions


Time required to recover debt (years)                                 To make the data on the time, cost and outcome comparable across economies, several
                                                                      assumptions about the business and the case are used:
• Measured in calendar years
• Appeals and requests for extension are included                     - A hotel located in the largest city (or cities) has 201 employees and 50 suppliers. The hotel
                                                                      experiences financial difficulties.
Cost required to recover debt (% of debtor’s estate)                  - The value of the hotel is 100% of the income per capita or the equivalent in local currency of USD
                                                                      200,000, whichever is greater.
• Measured as percentage of estate value                              - The hotel has a loan from a domestic bank, secured by a mortgage over the hotel’s real estate.
• Court fees                                                          The hotel cannot pay back the loan, but makes enough money to operate otherwise.
• Fees of insolvency administrators                                   In addition, Doing Business evaluates the quality of legal framework applicable to judicial
• Lawyers’ fees                                                       liquidation and reorganization proceedings and the extent to which best insolvency practices have

• Assessors’ and auctioneers’ fees
• Other related fees
Outcome

• Whether business continues operating as a going concern or
  business assets are sold piecemeal

Recovery rate for creditors

• Measures the cents on the dollar recovered by secured
  creditors

• Outcome for the business (survival or not) determines the
  maximum value that can be recovered

• Official costs of the insolvency proceedings are deducted
• Depreciation of furniture is taken into account
• Present value of debt recovered
Strength of insolvency framework index (0- 16)

• Sum of the scores of four component indices:
• Commencement of proceedings index (0-3)
• Management of debtor’s assets index (0-6)
• Reorganization proceedings index (0-3)
• Creditor participation index (0-4)

Proceeding              liquidation (after an      As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets, it will file a declaration of cessation of
                        attempt at                 payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing Collective Proceedings for Wiping Off Debts). In order to continue
                        reorganization)            operating, Mirage will try to obtain the opening of reorganization proceedings and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a
                                                   composition proposal is a proposal lodged no later than 15 days following the declaration of cessation of payments,
                                                   specifying the measures and conditions envisaged to redress the company. According to our information, Mirage will
                                                   not reach an agreement with its creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                                   proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the Uniform Act). A
                                                   reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most likely proceeding in Senegal.


Outcome                 piecemeal sale             According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the proceedings will probably be converted to
                                                   liquidation. The hotel will stop operating and will be dismantled, and the assets of the debtor will be sold separately.


Time (in years)         3.0                        Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of reorganization proceedings. The
                                                   declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation of payments. The competent court will then declare
                                                   cessation of payments and open reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail, so the proceedings
                                                   will be converted to liquidation. According to our estimations, the complete process of a reorganization attempt that is
                                                   then converted to liquidation takes approximately 36 months.


Cost (% of estate)      20.0                       According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into liquidation costs approximately 20%
                                                   of the value of the estate. The following cost components are applicable: lawyer fees (5-10%), bailiff fees (15%), court
                                                   fees, costs of publication and registration (1%).
